## Introduction
This movie recommender system aims to replicate the functionality of platforms like Netflix by suggesting movies to users based on their preferences. By leveraging user ratings and reviews, the system provides personalized recommendations, ensuring that users discover movies they are likely to enjoy.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and includes a comprehensive list of movies released from 1992 to the present. The dataset contains various features such as movie titles, genres, user ratings, and reviews.

## Features
- **Data Transformation:** Addressed data sparsity by transforming the matrix forms to improve the performance of the recommendation algorithm.
- **Efficiency:** Optimized the recommendation algorithm to achieve a complexity of O(mnlogn), ensuring fast and efficient performance.
- **Personalized Recommendations:** Utilized user ratings and reviews to provide tailored movie recommendations.

## Algorithms and Techniques
The project employs various algorithms and techniques to achieve its goals:
- **Collaborative Filtering:** Used collaborative filtering to identify similar users and recommend movies based on their preferences.
- **Matrix Factorization:** Applied matrix factorization techniques to handle data sparsity and improve recommendation accuracy.
- **Optimization:** Implemented algorithmic optimizations to ensure that the recommendation process is efficient and scalable.
## Usage
To use the recommender system, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the dataset in the appropriate directory.
2. Run the main script to train the model and generate recommendations:
   ```bash
   python main.py
## Results
The recommender system has been tested to achieve exceptional accuracy and efficiency in providing movie recommendations. The optimization techniques reduced the complexity from O(n) to O(mnlogn), significantly improving performance. Additionally, by addressing data sparsity issues through matrix transformation and factorization, the system ensures robust and reliable recommendations even with sparse data. The reduction in complexity from O(n) to O(mnlogn) has greatly enhanced the system's ability to handle large datasets efficiently.
